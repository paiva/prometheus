Prometheus
==========

The Prometheus project is an ongoing project at McGill University that aims to create a fully intelligent brain similar to our own by simulating lower life forms such as ants and gradually working towards fully autonomous robots. This project uses the Prometheus architecture to expand the functionality of the AI brain by implementing a database component using XML files, adding a large amount of information into the database, and then testing this system for its efficiency and correctness.
